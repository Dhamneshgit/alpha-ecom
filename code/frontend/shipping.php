<h3>GROCYPAY Shopping Policy</h3>
<p>This shopping policy applies to the GROCYPAY app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by GROCYPAY TECHPLATFORM PVT LTD (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Commercial service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

<br>
<br>
<h3>Orders and Payments</h3>
<p>The Application facilitates the purchase of goods and services. When you place an order, you agree to the pricing, payment terms, and availability of the items. Payments can be made using the methods specified in the Application.</p>

<ul>
  <li>All prices are inclusive of applicable taxes unless otherwise stated.</li>
  <li>Payment must be received in full before your order is processed.</li>
  <li>Once an order is placed, it cannot be modified or canceled after the order has been processed.</li>
  <li>The Service Provider reserves the right to refuse or cancel any order at their sole discretion.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
<h3>Shipping and Delivery</h3>
<p>The Service Provider will endeavor to deliver your order within the estimated timeframes. However, the actual delivery may vary due to factors beyond the Service Provider's control.</p>

<p><b>Shipping Methods:</b> The Service Provider offers various shipping methods. The method you choose will determine the delivery time.</p>
<p><b>Tracking Information:</b> Once your order is shipped, you will receive tracking information to monitor your shipment's progress.</p>
<p><b>Delivery Delays:</b> The Service Provider is not responsible for delays caused by carriers or other external factors.</p>

<p>Shipping fees are non-refundable once the order has been shipped. In case of a delivery failure due to incorrect address details provided by you, you may be liable for additional shipping fees.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h3>Returns and Refunds</h3>
<p>Items purchased through the Application can be returned under certain conditions specified by the Service Provider.</p>

<p>To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging.</p>

<p><b>Return Process:</b> Contact <a href="mailto:grocypay@gmail.com">grocypay@gmail.com</a> to initiate a return. Provide your order number and reason for return.</p>
<p><b>Refunds:</b> Refunds will be processed after the returned item has been received and inspected by the Service Provider. The refund will be credited to your original payment method within a specified period.</p>

<p>Shipping costs for returning an item are your responsibility unless the return is due to the Service Provider's error (e.g., wrong or defective item).</p>

<br>
<br>
<h3>Third Party Vendors</h3>
<p>The Service Provider may offer products from third-party vendors through the Application. These vendors have their own policies regarding shipping, returns, and refunds. The Service Provider is not responsible for the policies or practices of these third-party vendors.</p>

<p>Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services for payment processing, shipping, and other functionalities. Below are the links to the policies of the third-party service providers used by the Application:</p>

<h3>Order Cancellations</h3>
<p>You may cancel your order before it has been processed and shipped. Once an order has been shipped, it cannot be canceled, and you will need to follow the return process.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h3>Product Availability</h3>
<p>The Service Provider makes every effort to ensure that the products listed in the Application are available. However, product availability is subject to change without notice. If an item is out of stock after you place an order, you will be notified, and a refund or alternative option will be offered.</p>
